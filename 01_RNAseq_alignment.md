# RNA-seq Alignent

Welcome to an introduction of RNA-seq analysis, a part of the High Throughput Sequencing Facility introduction to Deep Sequencing Analysis.

### Loading modules

One of the first things we'll have to do is load up all our modules. On Kure and Killdevil, there are many applications and programs pre-installed. To use them, you simply need to load them!

The applications we'll load up for today will be:   
TOPHAT2   
R   
SAMTOOLS   
BEDTOOLS   

To load them, type:
```
module load tophat2
module load r
module load samtools
module load bedtools
```
