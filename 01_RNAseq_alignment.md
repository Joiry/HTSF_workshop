# RNA-seq Alignent

Welcome to an introduction of RNA-seq analysis, a part of the High Throughput Sequencing Facility introduction to Deep Sequencing Analysis.

## 0. Setup

### Log in

Login to Killdevil with your onyen.

### Load modules

One of the first things we'll have to do is load up all our modules. On Kure and Killdevil, there are many applications and programs pre-installed. To use them, you simply need to load them!

The applications we'll load up for today will be:   
TOPHAT2   
R   
SAMTOOLS   
BEDTOOLS   

To load them, type:

```
$ module load tophat2
$ module load r
$ module load samtools
$ module load bedtools
```

To learn more about modules, read [Getting Started with Killdevil -- Application Environment](http://help.unc.edu/help/getting-started-on-killdevil/#P92_10973).


### Start a directory structure

It is REALLY important to stay organized while performing computational projects. If you can't keep track or keep a record of what you are doing, you will have to do it again! So it is time efficient to take good notes and to keep things well organized.

Let's make a file structure. 

Start by creating the directory where you will conduct your analysis. I typically give my project ProjectNumbers.

```
$ mkdir 002_RNASeqDemo
$ cd 002_RNASeqDemo
```

OK, now we are inside the directory `002_RNASeqDemo`. Now that we are here, initiate the project by starting some sub-directories and a README document.

```
$ mkdir 00_logs
$ mkdir 01_ref
$ mkdir 02_raw
$ mkdir 03_processed
$ mkdir 04_results
$ mkdir 05_bin
```

### Get the dataset:

We will obtain a demonstration dataset. We are going to use a set of 10 files that came from 10 different RNAseq libraries (5
Male cell lines, 5 female cell lines).

Acknowledgement: This data was generated by Dr. Mauro Calabrese (Assistant Professor, Pharmacology, UNC-CH). We are using a small subset of reads in interest of time. A real dataset will be multiple times this size. You will find the data files in /proj/seq/data/RNAseq-HSL/reads/ directory. We have two groups of cell-lines. Samples are divided into five male and five female cell lines. These are paired-end 75 bp Illumina NextSeq 500 reads.

We will copy these files to your project directory:


```
$ cd 02_raw/
$ cp /proj/seq/data/RNAseq-HSL/reads/*.fastq.gz .
$ ls
```
